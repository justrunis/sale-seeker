### Environment Variables

To run the frontend application, you need to set the following environment variables:

- `VITE_API_URL` - The URL of the API server that the frontend application will communicate with.
- `VITE_SITE_KEY` - The site key for integrating reCAPTCHA with your frontend application.
- `VITE_SITE_SECRET` - The site secret for integrating reCAPTCHA with your frontend application.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and assign values to these variables based on your environment. Ensure not to expose sensitive information in your version control system.
